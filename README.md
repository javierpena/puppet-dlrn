## Overview
This is a Puppet module aimed at setting up a new DLRN instance from
scratch.

## Module Description

[DLRN](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/DLRN) builds and maintains yum repositories following OpenStack uptream commit streams.

The DLRN infrastructure on an instance contains the following components:

- A number of `workers`. A worker is basically a local user, with a local DLRN checkout from the GitHub repo, and some associated configuration.
- An `rdoinfo` user. This user simply hosts a local checkout of the [rdoinfo repository](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo), which is refreshed periodically using a crontab entry.
- A web server to host the generated repos.

You can find more information on the DLRN instance architecture [here](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/delorean-instance/blob/master/docs/delorean-instance.md).

This module can configure the basic parameters required by a DLRN instace, plus all the workers.

## Setup

    $ yum -y install puppet
    $ git clone https://github.com/javierpena/puppet-dlrn
    $ cd puppet-dlrn
    $ puppet module build
    $ puppet module install pkg/jpena-dlrn-*.tar.gz

## Usage

Once the puppet-dlrn module is installed, you will need to create a suitable Hiera file to define the workers. You have an example file at `examples/common.yaml`. Just place it at `/var/lib/hiera/common.yaml`, and it will create the same configuration that is currently being used at the production DLRN environment. If you need a different set of workers, just modify the file accordingly to suit your needs.

The simplest Puppet manifest that creates a DLRN environment for you is:

```puppet
class { 'dlrn': }
```

This is a simplistic manifest, that sets everything based on default values. Specifically, the following parts will be disabled:

- E-mail notifications when package builds fail.
- The cron jobs used to trigger periodic DLRN runs.

Once you have been able to check that everything is configured as expected, you need to do two things to set the DLRN instance in "production mode":

- Set `enable_worker_cronjobs: &enable_cron true` and `disable_worker_email: &disable_email false` in /`var/lib/hiera/common.yaml`.
- Change the Puppet manifest to look like the following:

```puppet
class { 'dlrn':
  sshd_port              => 3300,
}
```

## Reference

### Class: dlrn

This is the higher level class, that will configure a DLRN instance.

```puppet
class { 'dlrn':
  sshd_port         => 1234,
  server_type       => 'primary',
  enable_https      => false
}
```

####`sshd_port`
Specifies the alternate port sshd will use to listen to. This is useful when you need to access your DLRN instance over the Internet, to reduce the amount of automated attacks against sshd.

####`server_type`
Defines the server_type. It can be set to primary (default) or passive. Even when enabled in workers hiera configuration, passive servers will not enable:
- cron jobs for run-dlrn.sh
- rsync of new builds (they are suposed to be the destination of the synchronization)
- Opening reviews in gerrit automatically on FTBFS
- Sending mails on build failure
Additionally, passive servers will redirect to buildlogs when users trying to access to current-passed-ci or current-tripleo

####`enable_https`
Enable ssl in apache configuration. Certificates are managed using Let's Encrypt service. Defaults to false.


### Class: dlrn::common

This class is used internally, to configure the common OS-specific aspects required by DLRN.

```puppet
class { 'dlrn::common':
  sshd_port         => 1234,
}
```

####`sshd_port`
Specifies the alternate port sshd will use to listen to.

####`enable_https`
Enable ssl in apache configuration. Certificates are managed using Let's Encrypt service. Defaults to false.

####`disk_for_builders`
If set, it will use the specified disk to create a volume group called vgdelorean and mount it as /home, so all builders will be stored there. Defaults to `undef`.

### Class: dlrn::fail2ban

This class is used internally, and configures fail2ban for DLRN.

```puppet
class { 'dlrn::fail2ban' :
  sshd_port => 1234,
}
```

####`sshd_port`
Specifies the alternate port sshd will use to listen to.

### Class: dlrn::promoter

This class is used internally, to set up a promoter user for DLRN. This user is dedicated to promoting repositories that pass CI tests.

```puppet
class { 'dlrn::promoter' : }
```

### Class: dlrn::rdoinfo

This class is used internally, to set up an rdoinfo user for DLRN. This user is dedicated to synchronizing the contents of [rdoinfo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo).

```puppet
class { 'dlrn::rdoinfo' : }
```

### Class: dlrn::web

This class is used internally, to set up the Apache instance for DLRN and fetch the static content.

```puppet
class { 'dlrn::web' : }
```

####`web_domain`
Specifies the domain name used for the web server running in dlrn server.

####`enable_https`
Enable ssl in apache configuration. Certificates are managed using Let's Encrypt service. Defaults to false.

####`cert_mail`
The email address to use to register with Let's Encrypt. Required if enable_https is set to true.

####`enable_api`
Enable the DLRN API. This is done by creating a WSGI process under apache, and each enabled worker will get its own URL. Defaults to false.

####`api_workers`
If `enable_api` is true, this array will define which workers will be added to the vhost configuration as WSGI. Each worker will have a url of /api-${worker} associated to its WSGI script.

### Define dlrn:worker

This defined resource type creates all required configuration for a DLRN worker. It is used internally by class dlrn, but it may also be used externally from the site manifest to create additional workers.

```puppet
dlrn::worker { 'fedora-master':
  distro         => 'f24',
  target         => 'fedora',
  distgit_branch => 'rpm-master',
  distro_branch  => 'master',
  disable_email  => true,
  enable_cron    => false,
  symlinks       => ['/var/www/html/f24',
                      '/var/www/html/fedora24'],
  release        => 'newton',
}
```

####`distro`

Defaults to `undef`.

####`downstream_distro_branch`
If pkginfo_driver is 'dlrn.drivers.downstream.DownstreamInfoDriver', this option specifies the  branch to use when cloning the downstream distgit, since it may be different from the upstream distgit branch. Defaults to `undef`.

####`downstream_tag`
If pkginfo_driver is'dlrn.drivers.downstream.DownstreamInfoDriver', this option will filter the 'packages' section of packaging metadata (from 'repo/info_files') to only contain packages with the 'downstream_tag' tag.

####`koji_fetch_mock_config`
If build_driver is 'dlrn.drivers.kojidriver.KojiBuildDriver', when this option is set to true, DLRN will download the mock configuration for the build target from Koji, and use it when building the source RPM.  If set to 'false', DLRN will use its internally defined mock configuration, based on the ``DEFAULT/target`` configuration option. Defaults to `false`.

####`koji_use_rhpkg`

Defaults to `undef`.

####`enable_deps_sync`
When set to true a cron job is created to synchronize dependencies from CBS into $HOME/data/repos/deps/latest in primary server.

####`enable_brs_sync`
When set to true a cron job is created to synchronize build dependencies from CBS into $HOME/data/repos/build-deps/latest in primary server.

####`allow_force_rechecks`
When set to `true`, allow force rechecks of successfully built commits. Please note that this is not advisable if you rely on the DLRN-generated repositories, since it will remove packages that other hashed repositories may have symlinked. Defaults to `false`.

####`custom_preprocess`
If set, this parameter defines a comma-separated list of custom programs or scripts to be called as part of the pre-process step. The custom programs will be executed sequentially. Defaults to `undef`.

####`keep_changelog`
If set to `true`, DLRN will not clean the %changelog section from spec files when building the source RPM. When set to the default value of false, DLRN will remove all changelog content from specs.
Defaults to `false`.

## Limitations

The module has been tested on Fedora and CentOS.

**Important note about letsencrypt module:**This module requires puppet module letsencrypt > 1.0.0 (commit 3c5d17697f14a32f51b24d11f5c6a164d43c1a54 is required). At the time of writing this version of puppet-dlrn, latest version in puppetforge is 1.0.0 so until it's updated in puppetforge it must be cloned from  https://github.com/danzilio/puppet-letsencrypt.
